# Project Rules

- All CSS files go in the `src/css` folder.
- Each major component (e.g., Home, Auth, JournalEntry) has its own CSS file: `home.css`, `auth.css`, `journal-entry.css`.
- Global styles and resets are in `body.css`.
- Color variables are defined in `colors.css` (e.g., `--color-light`, `--color-dark`, `--color-accent`).
- Font variables and Google Fonts imports are in `fonts.css`.
